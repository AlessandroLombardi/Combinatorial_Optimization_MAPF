Solving the Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem with Constraint Programming (Docplex) and SAT/SMT (Z3Py).

Abstract:
&nbsp;

Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is a problem with practical implications in several fields: from robotics and self-driving cars to transportation and logistics. The task is to find non-conflicting paths for a set of agents given their starting positions and destinations, usually minimizing a cost function. There are many variations on the classical problem and many approaches have been proposed.
In this work we will focus on SAT and CP-based approaches following the paper of R. Bart&#259;k, J. &#348;vancara and M. Vlk, "A Scheduling-Based Approach to Multi-Agent Path Finding with Weighted and Capacitated Arcs", published in Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and MultiAgent Systems. As the authors suggest, this type of problem lends itself particularly well to be formalized using a compact set of constraints and we found interesting to developed as a project for our Combinatorial Decision Making and Optimization course.

pip install matplotlib==3.2.2

###### Conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

To solve locally with docplex IBM CPLEXÂ® Optimization Studio must be installed on the computer.

The folder
- solvers: contains the models.
- utils: contains environment.py to handle and generate environments and agents. animations.py to create animations.
- resources: some animations, the report and the cited paper.
- report: the report and bibliography in Latex.

&nbsp;

The test files are used to execute different environments.
Feel free to use the file mapf\_smt.py and mapf\_cp.py to perform personalized experiments.
